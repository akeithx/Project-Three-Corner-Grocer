# Project-Three-Corner-Grocer
CS 210 Corner Grocer

  This project was created in order to analyze a list of items purchased throughout the day, output these items, and create a histogram out of them. 
On this program I think I did well in passing information back and forth between python and c++ and I also did well in seperatting aspects of my code and labeling them. 
If I could do this project over or have more time to work on it I would have made more of my python code into functions so that way they could be used for new parts of code later in the future if the project was to ever be expaned
I found getting lists into python from c++ to be the most difficult thing to do, I ended up just changing the list to a string and then passing it to python where it was then changed back into a list
I have coded a good amount before, however I had little experience using multiple languages on one project before. What I have learned is very useful since most repostitories have multiple languages communicating back and forth and I would like to be able to understand and even be able to add to multiple language projects in the future.
I made this program readable by using in line comments explaining what my code was doing. I used multiple functions within c++ and python so this program should be able to be built upon in the future.
